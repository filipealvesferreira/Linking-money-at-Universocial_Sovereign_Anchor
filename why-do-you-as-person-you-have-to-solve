Because without persons the money is nothing. Then :
- there are no needs in monetary policy ;
- there are no needs in political production of money regulations.

Why you ?
Because things monetary, financial, spiritual nutrition and of institucional feeds, are coming from your person or are from your creation.

So because it is your legitimacy it's your responsibility to move.

Do you mean that because I have a respiratory problem, I have to consider myself a surgeon and operate on my own lungs?

What I would like to remind you is that you have a responsibility to notify the doctor of your illness. Just after, it is necessary that you start to collaborate on the solution.

Here in the money matters you have to collaborate to perform the five general functions to promote the effective operation of the World Economy and, more generally, the universocial public interest.

Blah, blah...no. Because the recipe is here. We have to put  time as a commodity, into the money guts.

And this surgery on the head, body and skin of money, does it hurt a lot?

Nothing. You just have to open your eyes and watch over. For surgeries, there are modern anesthesias for you to allow yourself to heal without the slightest pain.
Then when you wake up, open your eyes and watch more closely. It is the effort you must bring to resolve everything.
Then you will be able to meet all your needs and desires. And the others welfare, coming from you too.
